Description: Block Based Copy Protocol - high-performance file transfer tool
 bbcp is a file transfer tool designed to transfer large files at high speed
 across networks. It uses multiple parallel streams to maximize throughput,
 and supports features like:
 .
  - High-speed parallel transfers using multiple TCP streams
  - Data integrity verification with MD5, CRC32, and Adler32 checksums
  - Built-in zlib compression to reduce bandwidth usage
  - Real-time progress monitoring
  - Seamless integration with SSH for secure transfers
  - Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, AIX)
 .
 bbcp is particularly useful for transferring large datasets between
 research facilities, data centers, or over long-distance networks where
 traditional tools like scp may be slow.
